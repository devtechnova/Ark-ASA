Tribe names required and must be named appropriately (no racism, slurs, bunch of numbers, special characters, etc).\n\nG3. No cheating, meshing, or other exploits.\n\nG4. No abuse of ORP settings.\n\nG5. Be kind to new players, don't chase them off. No picking/dropping or attacking them/their dinos. If they're on or around the beaches, consider them \"new\".\n\nG6. This is a chill PvP server and we expect everyone to treat each other with respect. Shit talking is fine, toxic players/behavior will not be tolerated.
