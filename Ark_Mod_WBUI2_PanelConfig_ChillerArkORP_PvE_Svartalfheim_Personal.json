Rules are subject to change; by continuing to play on Chiller, you agree to all current and future rule updates. Admins have final say in what counts as a rule violation.\n\nG1. No Human, Humano, Survivor, 123, 321 or other generic or inappropriate character names. Tribe names are required, must be original and named appropriately (no racism, slurs, bunch of numbers or characters, mimicking other tribes, etc). Admins have the right to change these names if needed.\n\nG2. No cheating, meshing, or other exploits.\n\nG3. No abuse of ORP or PvE settings.\n\nG4. No caging/trapping or picking/dropping of other players/tamed dinos or stealing from other tribes.\n\nG5. No offline breeding - disable mating before you log off!\n\nG6. Keep the number of uncryo'd dinos to a minimum.\n\nG7. Admins will not get involved in any tribe drama, issues, disputes, etc. You are who you tribe with and you should be careful who you invite.\n\nG8. We expect everyone to treat each other with respect here. Swearing and shit talking is fine (we do it, too!), but toxic people/behavior will not be tolerated... just be chill! Making false statements about admins or the server can get you banned. Impersonating admins/staff in any form is grounds for immediate ban."

No build zones: artifact caves, major resources, notes, obs, boss areas/arenas, rare dino spawn zones/nests, drops, other tribes, or player spawn zones (pearl caves on The Island are OK to build in).\n\nB2. ONE base + ONE farming outpost (not in a good base spot or restricting access to areas in B1) per tribe. Spamming or blocking off a base location that you are not basing in is not permitted.\n\nB3. Clean up ALL traps, starter bases, rafts, temp builds, etc. Infinite pickup is enabled, please utilize it and help reduce server lag/load times!\n\nB4. No structure spam. Keep gates to a minimum - they're more expensive, USE HEAVIES AND ARB (both 1/2 craft cost!)."
