Impersonating admins/staff in any form will result in a ban.\n\nG2. No Human, Humano, Survivor, 123, 321 or other generic names (make a new character if needed). Tribe names are required, must be original and named appropriately (no racism, slurs, bunch of numbers or characters, mimicking other tribes, etc).\n\nG3. No cheating, meshing, or other exploits.\n\nG4. No abuse of ORP settings.\n\nG5. Be kind to new players, don't chase them off. No picking/dropping or attacking them/their dinos. If they're on or around the beaches, consider them \"new\".\n\nG6. No offline breeding - disable mating before you log off!\n\nG7. Caging or trapping players is generally frowned upon; this is limited to 15 mins and is only permitted during active raids.\n\nG8. This is a chill PvP server and we expect everyone to treat each other with respect. Swearing and shit talking is fine (we do it, too!), but toxic people will not be tolerated. Again we're here to have fun, not repeat the toxicity of ASE... so just be chill! Making false statements about admins or the server can get you banned. Impersonating admins/staff in any form is grounds for immediate ban."

ONE base + ONE farming outpost (not in a good base spot) per tribe. Turrets/dinos can only be at your base or outpost and cannot be restricting access to areas mentioned in B1. Spamming or blocking off a base location that you are not basing in is not permitted.\n\nB3. Clean up ALL traps, starter bases, rafts, temp builds, FOBs (within 24hrs), etc. Infinite pickup is enabled, please utilize it and help reduce server lag/load times!\n\nB4. No structure spam. Anti-FOB spam can only be placed up to 40 snapped foundation spaces away from last tower and cannot be excessive.\n\nB5. No dino builds covering the body (must be able to be shot/killed).\n\nB5. No mesh bases. This includes, but IS NOT limited to: tame-only entrances (e.g. a Pelagornis hole), knockout, zipline, tek punching, grapple spots, etc. Mesh bases are grounds for immediate tribe wipe and ban."

No trapping players inside their base or FOBs with turrets, structures, dinos, sniping, or building into another tribes base; tribes must be able to physically exit and rebuild defenses.\n\nR5. No harpoon, cannon, ballista, or magmasaur raiding.\n\nR6. Tribes actively participating in an event cannot be attacked/raided.\n\nR7. No killing of passive tames! Tranqing to check for loot stashes is OK (tip: save darts - use the U+ binos to check weight)"
